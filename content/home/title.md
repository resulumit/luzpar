This is a demonstration website, for [a workshop on automated web scraping](https://github.com/resulumit/scrp_workshop) --- by [Resul Umit](https://resulumit.com/).

It includes fabricated data on the imaginary Parliament of Luzland --- such as  [documents](documents/) in its recent history, latest election results in its one hundred [constituencies](constituencies/), and voting statistics of its as many [members](members/).

Luzland is imagined to be a federal republic, made up of four [states](states/), each with an equal number of constituencies.

Hence the website provides the workshop with plenty of data, stable structure, and an ethical playground.

Happy harvesting!
