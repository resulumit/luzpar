This is a demonstration website, for [a workshop on automated web scraping](https://github.com/resulumit/scrp_workshop) --- by [Resul Umit](https://resulumit.com/).

It includes fabricated data on the imaginary Parliament of Luzland --- such as  [documents](/documents/) in its recent history, latest election results in its one hundred [constituencies](/constituencies/), and voting statistics of its as many [members](/members/).

Luzland is imagined to be a federal republic, made up of four [states](/states/), each with an equal number of constituencies.

Hence the website provides the workshop with plenty of data, stable structure, and an ethical playground.

The website is powered by [Blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and [Wowchemy](https://github.com/wowchemy) --- all free and open source tools to build websites.

Happy harvesting!
