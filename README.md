Source files for a demonstration website 
=================================

All files for https://luzpar.netlify.app &mdash; a demonstration website, for a workshop on automated web scraping.

The website includes fabricated data on the imaginary Parliament of Luzland, such as documents in its recent history, latest election results in its one hundred constituencies, and voting statistics of its as many members.

The website is generated with [Blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/). The design is a modification of [Wowchemy's academic theme](https://github.com/wowchemy/starter-academic).
